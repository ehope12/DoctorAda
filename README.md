# DoctorAda

## Overview

This is a platform where doctors can consult with peers on complex cases, share insights, and ask for second opinions. It will have a database where doctors can access research articles and (both complete and ongoing) case studies and clinical trials in their field. The platform will have specialized forums for various medical fields and the option for video consultations. It can also include AI-driven recommendations based on their interests and specialities.

## Purpose

We aim to solve issues related to limited access to novel and up-to-date opinions and information when doctors are trying to troubleshoot unique patient cases. Allowing them to converse with one another can streamline the process of finding reputable sources that can inform their diagnoses.  
The target audience for this website is healthcare professionals who are looking for ways to connect with others in their field of expertise for advice and discuss recent developments in related research.
